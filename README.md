# Js-training

#### The objective of this project is to train anyone who wants to learn how to code to the basics of programming.

###### These exercises have been written in Javascript. To carry them out, it is necessary to install on your workstation:

- A language editor (Visual code)
- A source manager (Git)
- A NodeJS javascript code interpreter

#### Thanks to these exercises, the learner will be able to understand the following algorithmic concepts:

1. Initialize variables
2. Browse the values of an array
3. Searching for a value in an array
